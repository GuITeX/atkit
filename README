This Author's Kit for ArsTeXnica contains the following files:

* arsacro.sty (commands to typeset TeX-related names and logos);
* arstexnica.bst (bibliography style; natbib customization);
* arstexnica.cls (journal class);
* guit.sty (commands to typeset GuIT and ArsTeXnica-related names and logos);
* name-article.tex (see below);
* name-command.tex (see below);
* name-package.tex (see below);
* name.tex (see below);
* README (this file);
* README_it (Italian translation of this file).

The first four file are necessary (arstexnica.* are fundamental), and the 
name*tex files are those the author will modify according to her needs.

* <name>.tex: this is the master document, where preamble and the packages 
	needed to compile ArsTeXnica papers are written. You shouldn't modify
	anything, since inputenc loads now the utf8x option. The only change
	is that one in the file name, which has to be modified now;

* <name>-article.tex: here you'll only write the paper's text; no package
	inclusion, no commands. Following the required specs helps us to fix
	the script that gathers the papers and generates the current issue.
	Change <name> according to the master file's;

* <name>-package.tex: write here all the packages you're going to use in your 
	paper. It's advisable to write here the package listings' 
	customization. As usual, <name> has to be the same as the master file;

* <name>-command.tex: write here all and only those custom commands needed in
	your paper. Two advices: don't write a non-strictly necessary command.
	Often you find the same command (eventually with the same name) in
	already available packages; the latter one should be significantly
	more robust since a lot of users have probably tested it in different
	environments. It is common that two or more authors use the same name
	for their commands (e.g., \progname); this leads to compilation errors
	or to result's inconsistency. Please get used to custom your commands, 
	for instance including your initials in the command name: \GPprogname 
	could be a good name for my version of that command. This doesn't 
	zeroize, but greately reduces, the probability of conflicts among
	command names used by different authors.
