This Author's Kit for ArsTeXnica contains the following files:

* arsacro.sty (commands to typeset TeX-related names and logos);
* arstexnica.bib (bibliographic database);
* arstexnica.bst (bibliography style; natbib customization);
* arstexnica.cls (journal class);
* guit.sty (commands to typeset GuIT and ArsTeXnica-related names and logos);
* name.tex (see below);
* README (this file);
* README_it (Italian translation of this file).

The first five files are necessary (arstexnica.* are fundamental), and
the name.tex file is the file which the author will modify according
to her needs.

* <name>.tex: this is the master document, where preamble and the packages 
	needed to compile ArsTeXnica papers are written. You can typeset your
	paper with any typesetting program among pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, or LuaLaTeX.
	Please, specify with a comment line just before the \documentclass statement 
	which typesetting program you are using for your paper.
	You shouldn't modify anything, since the preamble takes care of anything 
	you might need, but you are allowed to add other languages and other fonts
	if your paper requires them. 
	You must change the file <name>, which must be the same here and in the
	following .tex files.

The required class and package files are the following.

* arstexnica.cls is the class file required to typesett every article and 
  the whole magazine.
  
* arstexnica.bst is the style file for typesetting the bibliography.

* arstexnica.bib the the complete bibliographic database containing all the
  necessary data connected to the articles already published on ArsTeXnica.
  
* arsacro.sty contains the definitions of the commands required to typeset
  the names of the majority of programs connected with TeX. 
  
* guit.sty contains the definitions of the macros required to typeset 
  ArsTeXnica's and GuIT's logos.
