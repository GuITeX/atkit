This Author's Kit for ArsTeXnica contains the following files:

* arsacro.sty (commands to typeset TeX-related names and logos);
* arstexnica.bib (bibliographic database);
* arstexnica.bst (bibliography style; natbib customization);
* arstexnica.cls (journal class);
* guit.sty (commands to typeset GuIT and ArsTeXnica-related names and logos);
* name-article.tex (see below);
* name-command.tex (see below);
* name-package.tex (see below);
* name.tex (see below);
* README (this file);
* README_it (Italian translation of this file).

The first five files are necessary (arstexnica.* are fundamental), and the 
name*.tex files are those the author will modify according to her needs.

* <name>.tex: this is the master document, where preamble and the packages 
	needed to compile ArsTeXnica papers are written. You can typeset your
	paper with any typesetting program among pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, or LuaLaTeX.
	Please, specify with a comment line just before the \documentclass statement 
	which typesetting program you are using for your paper.
	You shouldn't modify anything, since the preamble takes care of anything 
	you might need, but you are allowed to add other languages and other fonts
	if your paper requires them. 
	You must change the file <name>, which must be the same here and in the
	following .tex files.

* <name>-article.tex: here you'll only write the paper's text; no package
	inclusion, no commands. Following the required specs helps us to fix
	the script that gathers the papers and generates the current issue.
	Change <name> according to the master file's.

* <name>-package.tex: write here all the packages you're going to use in your 
	paper. It's advisable to write here the package listings' 
	customisation. As usual, <name> has to be the same as the master file's.

* <name>-command.tex: define here all and only those custom commands needed in
	your paper. Two advices: don't write a non-strictly necessary commands.
	Often you find the same command (possibly with the same name) in
	already available packages; the latter ones should be significantly
	more robust since a lot of users have probably tested them in different
	environments. It is common that two or more authors use the same name
	for their commands (e.g., \progname); this leads to compilation errors
	or inconsistencies. Please get used to custom your commands, 
	for instance including your initials in the command name: \GPprogname 
	could be a good name for my version of that command. This doesn't 
	eliminate, but greatly reduces the probability of conflicts among
	command names used by different authors.

The required class and package files are the following.

* arstexnica.cls is the class file required to typesett every article and 
  the whole magazine.
  
* arstexnica.bst is the style file for typesetting the bibliography.

* arstexnica.bib the the complete bibliographic database containing all the
  necessary data connected to the articles already published on ArsTeXnica.
  
* arsacro.sty contains the definitions of the commands required to typeset
  the names of the majority of programs connected with TeX. 
  
* guit.sty contains the definitions of the macros required to typeset 
  ArsTeXnica's and GuIT's logos.
